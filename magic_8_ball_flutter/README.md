# Magic 8 Ball

A decision making Flutter app.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The final outcome of this App is a tappable image showing in the centre of the device.
When you keep on tapping the image, it will keep changing!

I have used **dart:math** library to use the random calculation of choosing image numbers.
I have implemented a **StatefulWidget** to change the states of the image.
